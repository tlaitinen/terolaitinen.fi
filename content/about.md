Hi, I'm Tero. I work as a staff engineer at Wolt, currently focusing on improving the discovery experience of our consumer website. I care about scalable, secure, and delightful products and developing them with talented, motivated, and closely aligned professionals against well-thought-out abstractions and designs.

Architecture, type safety, test automation, infrastructure, security, and performance are dear topics, but serving customers and helping colleagues come first. I can be idealistic, e.g., with functional programming, but, in the end, I remain a pragmatist at heart and derive satisfaction from delivering reliable value-creating software.

Programming and computers have always fascinated me, no matter whether it's about computer science fundamentals or modern computer hardware's intricacies. I've also learned to appreciate the engineering and the business sides of computing. Before joining Wolt, I had the privilege to work in a family business (Audio Riders Oy), as a doctoral student researching the Boolean satisfiability problem ([Extending SAT Solver with Parity Reasoning](https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/items/cc7ad01b-fc9c-4d32-8b3c-a7c60ca936f5)), as a freelancer (Audience First, Sentina Oy, iProtoXi Oy), and as a co-founder (Underground City Oy, PipeKeeper Oy).

When not working, I enjoy spending time with my family, traveling, exercising, meditating, or reading inspiring literature. You can contact me by [email](mailto:tero@terolaitinen.fi).
